<h2>About Data</h2>

The data is about the coronovirus pandemic and the number of confirmed deaths from COVID-19.

The dataset was taken from <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths">Our World in Data</a>

<h2>Business Task</h2>

The task is to bring out insights about:

-How many deaths there were per continent.

-What is the percentage of population that was infected per country.

-What is the average percentage of population that was infected per country across months.

-How many deaths from total cases and what is the death percentage.

<h2>Data Preparation</h2>

In order to work with specific columns we splited in Excel the original file in two tables 'CovidDeaths' and 'CovidVaccinations'(too large file to upload).

Then we explored data in Microsoft SQL Server.

<h2>Visualisation</h2>
